# Real-Time-CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms
It contains different type of Real-time CPU scheduling Algorithms like Rate-Monotonic Scheduling and Earliest-Deadline-First Scheduling and their analysis by simulating and evaluating their performance(average waiting time and no. of missed deadline) in a multi-processor environment.

Input should be given using file "inp-params.txt" consisting of the following parameters:
1. n, The number of processes
2. followed by n lines consisting of P(i)(Process id), t(processing time), p(period) and k(the number of times each process repeats).
